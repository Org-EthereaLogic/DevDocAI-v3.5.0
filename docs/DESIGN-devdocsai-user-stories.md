- **AC-021.5**: Given GDPR timeline applies, when DSR is received, then response is provided within 30 days
- **AC-021.6**: Given data is exported, when packaging, then data is encrypted with user-provided key for secure transfer
- **AC-021.7**: Given deletion is complete, when confirming, then deletion certificate with timestamp and scope is generated
- **AC-021.8**: Given DSR history exists, when auditing, then all DSR requests and actions are logged with tamper-evident records

## Definition of Terms

**Entropy Metrics**: In DevDocAI context, a measure of document organization and information density. Lower entropy indicates better organized, more coherent documentation. Calculated using the MIAIR methodology formula: S(A,B,Tx) = -‚àë[p(xi) √ó log2(p(xi))] √ó f(Tx).

**Consistency Status Indicators**: Visual and textual markers showing alignment between related documents:

- Green (Aligned): Documents are in sync, no updates needed
- Yellow (Review Needed): Minor changes detected, review recommended  
- Red (Conflicts): Significant inconsistencies requiring immediate attention

**MIAIR Methodology**: Meta-Iterative AI Refinement - DevDocAI's approach using entropy measurements and recursive refinement to improve document quality through multiple AI model synthesis.

**Tracking Matrix**: Interactive visualization showing all documents, their versions, relationships, dependencies, and quality scores in a single unified view.

**Quality Gate**: Automated pass/fail threshold for documentation quality in CI/CD pipelines (85% minimum score).

**Progressive Disclosure**: UI pattern showing summary information first, with detailed information available on demand to prevent cognitive overload.

**Multi-LLM Synthesis**: Process of combining outputs from multiple Large Language Models (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) to achieve higher quality results than any single model.

**SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)**: Complete inventory of all software components, dependencies, and licenses in a project.

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that could potentially identify a specific individual.

**DSR (Data Subject Rights)**: Rights granted to individuals under privacy regulations like GDPR/CCPA to control their personal data.
